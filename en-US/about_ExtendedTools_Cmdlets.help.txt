  About  ExtendedTools

       ExtendedTools is a file transfer service that provides a scriptable interface 
      through Windows PowerShell.  ExtendedTools transfers files asynchronously in the 
      foreground or in the background. And, it automatically resumes file 
      transfers after network disconnections and after a computer is restarted.
   
      Background transfers use only idle network bandwidth in an effort to 
      preserve the user’s interactive experience with other network 
      applications such as Internet Explorer.  ExtendedTools does this by examining the 
      network traffic and then using only the idle portion of the network 
      bandwidth.  ExtendedTools continuously throttles its use of the bandwidth as the
      user increases or decreases their use of the bandwidth.  ExtendedTools performs 
      the transfers asynchronously, which means that your program or script 
      does not have to be running for  ExtendedTools to perform the transfer. Both
      uploads and downloads are supported.  ExtendedTools is particularly suitable for
      copying files from an HTTP location in an Internet Information Services 
      virtual directory to the logical drive of a client. Standard server 
      message block (SMB) copy operations are also supported. In addition to
      the scripting interface provided by Windows PowerShell,  ExtendedTools provides a 
      set of COM APIs to allow programming access. 

    
   ExtendedTools Transfer Types

      There are three types of  ExtendedTools transfer jobs:

          - A download job downloads files to the client computer.

          - An upload job uploads a file to the server.

          - An upload-reply job uploads a file to the server and receives a 
            reply file from the server application.

    
   ExtendedTools Transfer Persistence

       ExtendedTools continues to transfer files after an application exits if the user 
      who initiated the transfer remains logged on and if a network connection
      is maintained.  ExtendedTools suspends the transfer if a connection is lost or if 
      the user logs off.  ExtendedTools also persists the transfer information when a 
      user logs off, when network disconnections occur, and when a computer is
      restarted. When the user logs on again, when the network is reconnected, 
      and when the computer is restarted,  ExtendedTools resumes the user's transfer 
      job. 


   ExtendedTools Transfer Priority

       ExtendedTools provides one foreground and three background priority levels that 
      you can use to prioritize transfer jobs. Higher priority jobs preempt
      lower priority jobs. Jobs at the same priority level share transfer time,
      which prevents a large job from blocking small jobs in the transfer 
      queue. Lower priority jobs do not receive transfer time until all the 
      higher priority jobs are complete or in an error state. Background 
      transfers are optimal because  ExtendedTools uses idle network bandwidth to 
      transfer the files.  ExtendedTools increases or decreases the rate at which files 
      are transferred based on the amount of idle network bandwidth that is 
      available. If a network application begins to consume more bandwidth, 
       ExtendedTools decreases its transfer rate to preserve the user's interactive 
      experience.  ExtendedTools supports multiple foreground jobs and one background
      transfer job at the same time.


  Windows PowerShell and the  ExtendedTools Cmdlets

      Windows PowerShell implements  ExtendedTools functionality through the  ExtendedTools module
      for Windows PowerShell. The  ExtendedTools module loads a set of  ExtendedTools-specific 
      cmdlets. You can use these cmdlets to complete the end-to-end tasks 
      that are necessary to manage the transfer of files between computers.
 
      When the  ExtendedTools module for Windows PowerShell is loaded, the following 
       ExtendedTools cmdlets are available.

     
          Cmdlet                  Descriptions
          ---------               --------------------------------
          Add- ExtendedToolsFile            Adds one or more files to a  ExtendedTools transfer.
          Complete- ExtendedToolsTransfer   Completes a  ExtendedTools transfer.
          Get- ExtendedToolsTransfer        Gets a single or multiple  ExtendedTools transfer.
          Remove- ExtendedToolsTransfer     Deletes a  ExtendedTools transfer.
          Resume- ExtendedToolsTransfer     Resumes a suspended  ExtendedTools transfer.
          Set- ExtendedToolsTransfer        Configures  ExtendedTools transfer jobs.
          Start- ExtendedToolsTransfer      Creates and starts a  ExtendedTools transfer job.
          Suspend- ExtendedToolsTransfer    Suspends a  ExtendedTools transfer job.
 
      To copy a file using  ExtendedTools:

          1. Create a  ExtendedTools transfer job by using the Start- ExtendedToolsTranfer cmdlet,
             optionally with the Suspend parameter. 

          2. Add files to the  ExtendedTools transfer job by using the Add- ExtendedToolsFile 
             cmdlet. 

          3. Start the  ExtendedTools transfer by using the Resume- ExtendedToolsTransfer cmdlet. 

          4. Check the status of the  ExtendedTools transfer job by using the 
             Get- ExtendedToolsTransfer cmdlet.
 
  Sample Commands
   
      A simple Windows PowerShell  ExtendedTools file transfer command might resemble 
      the following command:
     
        C:\PS> Start- ExtendedToolsTransfer http://server01/servertestdir/testfile1.txt c:\clienttestdir\testfile1.txt
     
      
      A slightly more complex Windows PowerShell  ExtendedTools file transfer set of 
      commands might resemble the following command:
     
        C:\PS> Import-CSV filelist.txt | Start- ExtendedToolsTransfer -TransferType Upload


   ExtendedTools Server Configuration

      Background Intelligent Transfer Services ( ExtendedTools) server extends Internet 
      Information Services (IIS) to support throttled uploads that can be 
      restarted. To upload files to a server by using  ExtendedTools, the server must 
      be running IIS 7.0 and Windows Server 2008. Additionally, the  ExtendedTools server
      extension for the Internet Server Application Programming Interface 
      (ISAPI) must be installed. The  ExtendedTools server extension is a subcomponent of
      IIS. To use the upload feature, create an IIS virtual directory on the 
      server where clients can upload files. Create a virtual directory for 
      each type of client.  ExtendedTools adds properties to the IIS metabase 
      for the virtual directory that you create, and it uses these properties 
      to determine how to upload the files. For more information, see 
     "Setting Up the Server for Uploads" in the MSDN library at
